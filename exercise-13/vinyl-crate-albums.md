# Vinyl Crate Album Add and View

A new feature request has come in from the project manager.

The customer would like to be able to add new albums to their database and view their full collection.

An `Album` has been defined with the following properties:

* ArtistName
* AlbumName
* Genre
* ReleaseYear
* AlbumArtURL

The customer is preparing for Record Store Day 2016 and needs to only add their records and view them so they know which records they have. They may want to Edit at a later date, but the MVP includes on Add and View.

When viewing the Albums, the customer wants to see the album art, as well as all properties on the Album for easy reference. They also want the text to be blue because it is their favorite color.

Take some time to build out this feature using what we have learned in exercises #1-12.
