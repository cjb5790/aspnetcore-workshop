Building Your First Application With ASP.NET Core 1.0 Using Visual Studio Code and CLI: Microsoft has shaken and stirred the comfortable world of .NET with ASP.NET 5. Gone are the bitters of XML and MSBuild configurations (WebForms too). Instead, the new recipe calls for equal parts JSON and DNX (.NET Execution Environment), with a splash of Tag Helpers. Given a new project structure, runtime, and tool set, it’s easy to feel like the rug has been pulled out from under you. These new changes are less of an acquired taste than you might think. Let’s peel back the curtain by using just Visual Studio Code and the new command line tools to gain a better understanding of what this means for you as a developer. We’ll work through creating a new ASP.NET 5 app using Yeoman, establish our dependencies with the new package management (including npm for front end libraries), configure our database connection using dependency injection, and create our front end assets using Gulp. You’ll leave this workshop not only with a better understanding of the new .NET, but a functional application.
